# User Stories

As a user:

- I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

1. title
1. url link
1. description
1. rating (1-5)

- I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.

- All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.

- I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

- Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.

- I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

- I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.

- Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
  I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.

- I can edit a bookmark when clicking edit.
